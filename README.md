# Data Warehousing with Redshift
 A data warehouse project for the Udacity Data Engineer Nanodegree

 This README file includes a summary of the project, how to run the Python scripts, and an explanation of the files in the repository.

 ## Getting Started

 1.  You will need to first connect and build the tables for the  Sparkify database.  To do this run the following command:

 > python create_tables.py

 2. To load data into the  Sparkify database run the following command:

 >python etl.py

 ## Prerequisites
 1.  

 2.  


 ## Purpose
 The purpose of this database is to conduct ETL operations and store data from user activity from the Sparkify app.  
 This data will be used by the Sparkify analytics team will use this data gain a greater understanding of user activity and songs being listened to.


 ## Database Schema
 There are 5 tables in the database.  This design focuses on the songplay table which houses the most important information for the analytics team.  The supporting tables of time, users, songs, and artists help to provide context and additional details for the songplay table.

 ## Example Queries
 To get the top 5 users by session.

 >SELECT users.last_name, users.first_name, COUNT(songplay.user_id)
 FROM songplay
 INNER JOIN users ON songplay.user_id=users.user_id
 GROUP BY users.user_id
 ORDER BY count DESC
 LIMIT 5;

 ![top five](./assets/images/top_5.png)

 To get the 10 locations with the least amount of user sessions

 >SELECT songplay.location, count(songplay.location)
 FROM songplay
 where location is not null
 GROUP BY songplay.location
 ORDER BY count
 limit 10;
